bytes
=======

a small library of functions for handling byte arrays

This project offers a few convenient functions for 
manipulating byte arrays.   It seeks to supplement
rather than replace similar classes in Guava and
various Apache projects.  Nevertheless, this 
project might be attractive to projects that only
need the functions provided here and do not want
to include larger libraries.
